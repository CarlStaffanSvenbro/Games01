The Words game is an application that I (Carl-Staffan Svenbro) developed during my spare time. I wrote the app in XCODE with Swift. The current version corresponds to the video demonstration at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCcjkOGTgM. It is a type of text-based exploration game. Players communicate with the game through text commands. Commands are built by combining words under different word-class headings. Player input is restricted to a word combination of words available in each situation. I found that restricting player inputs is beneficial. It makes it easier for the game engine to interpret the player commands. It also makes it possible to make the game engine only accept player inputs that are grammatical. Furthermore, by checking listed words and possible combinations, the player gets a good idea of possible lines of action in each situation. The basis of Words is the situation. Each one is defined in relation to itself and connected situations. The situations are interrelated through distinct string commands. Expansion of the game takes place through a kind of game builder.The designer adds items, interconnections to new rooms etc. by first entering an existing situation and then add new connections to that situation.
